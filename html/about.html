                    "We need the tonic of wildness - to wade sometime in marshes where the bittern and the meadow -
                    hen lurk, and hear the booming of the snipe;
                    to smell the whispering sedge where only some wilder and more solitary
                    fowl builds her nest, and the mink crawls with its belly close to the ground.
                    <br>
                    At the same time that we are earnest to explore and learn all things, we require that all things be
                    mysterious and unexplorable, that land and sea be infinitely wild,
                    unsurveyed and unfathomed by us because unfathomable.
                    <br>
                    We can never have enough of nature. We must be refreshed by the sight of inexhaustible vigor,
                    vast and titanic features, the seacoast with its wrecks, the wilderness with its living and decaying
                    trees, the thundercloud, and the rain which lasts three weeks
                    and produces freshets.
                    <br>
                    We need to witness our own limits transgressed, and some life pasturing freely where we never
                    wander."
                    <br>
                    By Henry David Thoreau, quoted from Walden in the Spring Chapter.

                    My art covers my personal life as well as the world around me.
                    The art explores the mind of a teenager as well as the landscapes of Arizona wastelands.
                    It looks into modern thought, with a focus on color (or no color at all) and attention to detail.

                    The arts have been a constant part of my life for awhile now.
                    Growing up, my dad and mom would always share whatever music or movies they loved with me, and they
                    have fostered
                    my passion for the arts ever since then.
                    In 2012 the "Avengers" movie came out, and after seeing it in theatres I became a huge fan.
                    I would draw the Avengers over and over again.

                    Not long after my family crossed the ocean to live in Germany for 4 years, in which time I became
                    fluent in German.
                    At school (from 3rd grade to 6th grade) my art classes were very influential to me,
                    I learned how to be detailed, make collages, learned color technique, as well as inking, pencil art
                    and shading, and abstract art.
                    My final year in Germany, me and a friend started making comics together, which is another hobby
                    I've followed.

                    When we moved back to America, I also picked up photography and stop-motion.
                    My love of the MCU brought me to read some of Jim Lee's comics, and
                    I started practicing his style to better understand character design.
                    In 2016 "Spider-Man Into the Spidey-verse" came out, I was amazed by the animation as well as all
                    the detail and color that went
                    into just one scene, I've tried to put as much color and detail as I can into whatever I make.
                    I created my first digital comic in 2022 and
                    have around 70 finished works.

                    I'm a storyteller, an observer who loves to create or capture anything that should be enjoyed in
                    more depth.
